# About me
With extensive experience as a full-stack software developer, I specialize in building enterprise web applications and services using a variety of technologies, including Ruby on Rails, TypeScript, JavaScript, React, and SQL. I am also proficient in CI/CD, having worked with it professionally.

I am passionate about pursuing exciting software development opportunities in any area, including front-end, back-end, or full-stack development, and am equally comfortable working both independently and as part of a team.

For me, building software is truly an art form. I believe that the key to creating successful products lies in continuous iterative refinement, agility, and the ability to execute requirements effectively. Additionally, I strongly believe in the 80/20 ideology when it comes to software development practices, focusing on the 20% of tasks that will have an 80% impact on the project's success, ultimately leading to more efficient use of resources and accelerated progress.

My career goal is to continually enhance my skills and learn best practices to make a meaningful impact in the software industry.
